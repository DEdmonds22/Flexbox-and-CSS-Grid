/* FLEXBOX */
    /* Why Use Flexbox? */
        /* Flexbox excels at assisting devs w/ the following task: 
            + Vertically centering content & elements within a container element.
            + Spacing child elements within a container uniformly.
            + Making the height of child elements laid out in columns the same even though they have a different amount of content. */

    /* Flexbox Fundamentals */
        /* We use a CSS display: flex; declaration to make an element a flex container, for example:
            section {
                display: flex;
            }
        /* The code above makes all <section> elements flex container and all direct children become flex items */

    /* Your First Flexbox */
            /* By default nav & div elements are block elements. */
            /* Which element do we need to make the flex container? */
nav {
    display: flex;  /* nav display is no longer block, it's flex. */
    height: 50px;   /* sets height of nav bar to 50px */
    background-color: #a2cbb6;  /* set bg color of nav bar to #a2cbb6 */
    flex-direction: row;    /* default value, doesn't need to be set if default value */
    justify-content: flex-start;    /* default value, doesn't need to be set if default value */
}
            /* nav is now a flex container, and it's direct children (div) are now flex items, which are laid out in a row horizontally, the default layout of a flex container. */
            /* A flex container has a flex-direction property that defines the direction of its main axis. There are four values: 
                + row - the default; left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
                + row-reverse -  right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
                + column - same as row but top to bottom
                + column-reverse - same as row-reverse but bottom to top */
            /* A flex container has a main axis and a cross axis (represents the opposite direction of it's main axis). For example: 
                + If flex-direction: row; the: 
                    * main axis is horizontal
                    * cross axis is vertical
                + If flex-direction: column; the: 
                    * main axis is vertical
                    * cross-axis is horizontal */
            /* The concepts of main axis 7 cross axis come into play when it comes to sizing and layout properties, such as: 
                + justify-content: Controls alignment for the main axis
                    * flex-start - default
                    * flex-end
                    * start
                    * end
                    * left
                    * right
                    * center
                    * space-between
                    * space-around
                    * space-evenly
                + align-items: Controls alignment for the cross axis 
                    * stretch - default
                    * flex-start / start / self-start
                    * flex-end / end / self-end
                    * center

    /* Why use CSS Grid? */
        /* CSS Grid is a great option when you have:
            + Any components that would beneifit from a grid-typ layout such as a "profile card", in other words, CSS Grid doesn;t have to apply to the whole page - it can be useful for laying out smaller "components" as well. */

    /* CSS Grid Fundamentals */
        /* unlike Flexbox, CSS Grid lays out its grid items in two-dimensions */
        /* CSS Grids have the concept of the following:
            + Tracks - either a row or column

            + Areas - a x by x section
            + Gaps */
